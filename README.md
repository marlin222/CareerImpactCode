# Career Impact Code Repository

This repository contains the source code that had a significant impact on my software development career. The code addresses a complex optimization problem in the field of image processing, and it opened my eyes to the power of algorithmic thinking.

## Problem Description

The problem revolves around efficiently removing noise from high-resolution images while preserving essential details. Traditional approaches were slow and led to loss of image clarity.

## Problem-Solving Approach

The solution leverages a novel denoising algorithm inspired by neural networks. It employs a convolutional autoencoder to learn the underlying patterns in noisy images and then applies a reconstruction process to enhance image quality.

## Repository Contents

- `src/`: Contains the source code files for the denoising solution.
- `data/`: Holds sample noisy images for testing.
- `results/`: Stores the denoised output images generated by the algorithm.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and required dependencies installed.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Run the `main.py` script to execute the denoising algorithm on a sample image.
4. Find the denoised image saved in the `results/` directory.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt the code for your own projects!
